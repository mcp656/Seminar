Seminar: Asset Prices and Financial Markets (Grade A+/12). 

Abstract: 
Using U.S. data from 1989-2024, this study revisits the Mehra–Prescott consumption-based asset pricing
model. The standard calibration leaves almost the entire nine percentage-point equity premium
unexplained. Adding cumulative prospect theory with myopic loss aversion and bootstrapping
monthly returns shows that, with textbook parameters, equities and Treasury bills deliver equal utility
only at an 11-month evaluation horizon; the implied premium then matches reality but justifies a
25 percent equity share. Re-estimating the prospect-theory parameters narrows model error tenfold
and cuts the horizon to seven months, yet still predicts equity weights far below the 40–70 percent
held by diversified U.S. investors. Thus, loss-averse monitoring helps explain the premium's level but
not investors' heavy equity positions, pointing to the need for additional frictions such as disaster
risk or heterogeneity.
